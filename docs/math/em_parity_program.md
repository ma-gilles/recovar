# EM / RELION Parity Program Board

This is the living source of truth for the active milestone and next
experiment. Keep permanent rules in `recovar/em/AGENTS.md`, detailed dated
evidence in `docs/math/relion_parity_agent_notes.md`, and accepted completion
runs in `docs/math/em_parity_best_metrics.md`.

## Objective

First achieve near-perfect RELION quality parity for supplied-map K=1
auto-refine and K=4 3D classification. Then optimize to near RELION speed while
holding the accepted quality checkpoint. Treat native InitialModel/VDAM parity
as the next product milestone rather than mixing it into the first closure.

## Mode Contract

- **Strict oracle:** the default during parity closure; pinned RELION GUI
  behavior and full iteration trajectory, including `firstiter_cc` hard-winner
  semantics.
- **Quality:** a later opt-in during parity closure; an intentional RELION
  difference is acceptable only when named and FSC/FSC-AUC against GT is
  neutral or better.
- **Performance:** exact accepted quality behavior with timing instrumentation;
  no algorithmic approximation without separate quality qualification.

## Current State — 2026-07-11

Authoritative candidate worktree:
`/scratch/gpfs/GILLES/mg6942/recovar_dev/recovar_em_min_deferred_abs2_20260709_1745`

Recorded HEAD before this board was created:
`4fba8f48a00ca7820a763e7ba41dac4a5a8d8242` on
`codex/em-deferred-bigjit-abs2-min-20260709` with a large dirty candidate stack.
Every new run must record a fresh diff SHA-256 and untracked manifest.

Known evidence:

- K=1 100k/256 map quality is excellent: merged RECOVAR-vs-RELION correlation
  `0.999571`, FSC-AUC `0.994387`, and RECOVAR GT FSC-AUC is `+0.009573` above
  RELION. RECOVAR is about `1.40x` RELION wall time on the recorded run.
- K=1 free-trajectory Pmax diverges beginning at iter 2, but an exact fixed
  RELION it001-to-it002 replay of worst particles gives Pmax correlation `1.0`,
  mean absolute gap `0.000309`, max `0.000917`, and exact pose/translation.
  Therefore the active strict-parity bug is state history, with iter-1
  `firstiter_cc` policy the leading cause, not E-step arithmetic.
- K=4 100k/256 map quality is close/better by GT FSC-AUC, but particle-level
  state parity is incomplete: recorded class agreement `0.89025`, pose within
  5 degrees `0.71669`, translation within 1 px `0.77529`. Runtime is `2.181x`
  RELION; sparse K-class pass 2 dominates the completed iteration wall.
- Exact local x-half current/full BPref microbatching now survives the recorded
  3k/128 stress case without OOM. The conservative cap is validated for that
  fixture, not yet a universal optimal cap.

Canonical evidence and paths are in `docs/math/relion_parity_agent_notes.md`
and `docs/math/em_parity_best_metrics.md`.

## Quantitative Gates

These are program gates, not arbitrary test tolerances. Change them only by an
explicit user decision.

### Fixed-state arithmetic

- score/Pmax p95 absolute gap `<=1e-4` where RELION GPU arithmetic permits;
- maximum gap `<1e-3` unless a CPU/double adjudication explains it;
- exact best pose/class/translation agreement when the winning margin is above
  the numerical band; near-tie flips require candidate score/posterior evidence
  that the inputs agree within the numerical contract;
- no systematic drift by half, class, shell, pass, or candidate count.

### K=1 supplied-map quality

- merged RECOVAR-vs-RELION map correlation `>=0.9995`;
- merged RECOVAR-vs-RELION FSC-AUC `>=0.995`;
- RECOVAR GT FSC-AUC no worse than RELION by more than `0.002`;
- strict-mode per-iteration state differences are arithmetic-level after the
  first-iteration policy is matched;
- convergence iteration and final all-data path agree exactly.

### K=4 supplied-map quality

- Hungarian-matched mean class map correlation `>=0.999`, worst class
  `>=0.998`;
- per-class GT FSC-AUC no worse than RELION by more than `0.002` without a
  documented quality-mode improvement;
- class agreement `>=99%`, with pose/translation distributions reported per
  class and no collapsed/minority class;
- convergence/finalization semantics agree.

### Performance

- quality freeze first, then intermediate K=4 target `<=1.5x` RELION and K=1
  target `<=1.2x`;
- completion target K=4 `<=1.2x` and K=1 `<=1.1x` on the same pinned hardware;
- report compilation separately and include end-to-end time, per-stage time,
  throughput, and peak memory.

## Milestones And Exit Criteria

1. **Freeze reproducible oracle and candidate.** Create a clean checkpoint or
   reviewable logical commit series from the current stack; pin RELION build,
   fixtures, commands, and hardware. Exit when any result can be reproduced
   from immutable identities.
2. **Close K=1 strict trajectory parity.** Implement or qualify strict
   `firstiter_cc` semantics, compare every state boundary, and match
   convergence/finalization. Exit when K=1 gates pass across small robustness
   cells, at least one real-particle confirmation, and the 100k/256 completion
   case.
3. **Close K=4 quality and state parity.** Find first divergence before final
   maps, repair class/pose/translation trajectory and finalization, and cover
   class imbalance/noise/CTF stress. Exit when K=4 gates pass.
4. **Freeze quality checkpoint.** Tag/commit the accepted behavior and lock a
   reproducible K=1/K=4 benchmark matrix. No performance patch proceeds when
   its quality comparison is missing.
5. **Optimize K=4.** Attack measured sparse pass-2 and M-step/noise bottlenecks
   one at a time with output equivalence tests.
6. **Optimize K=1.** Reduce pass-2/local overhead, compilation, and memory
   traffic while retaining the quality checkpoint.
7. **Expand scope.** Native InitialModel/VDAM, broader distributions, larger
   boxes/counts, and additional GPU architectures after supplied-map closure.

## Active Milestone

Milestone 1 is partially complete but blocked by the broad dirty candidate
stack. The first scientific target is Milestone 2.

### Next experiment

Create a K=1 strict-mode A/B on the existing 5k/128 fixture from identical
RELION iter-0 state:

- A: current RECOVAR quality-mode first iteration;
- B: strict hard-winner `firstiter_cc` with RELION winner-subset pass-2 routing;
- compare the complete iter-1 state and fixed-state iter-1-to-iter-2 outputs;
- stop at the first state field where B still differs materially.

Success means B collapses the iter-2 free-trajectory Pmax gap toward the
fixed-state arithmetic band without degrading maps. Failure means the next
experiment moves to the earliest mismatched iter-1 state field rather than
changing later kernels.

In parallel only when authorized: audit K=4 per-iteration dumps to identify the
first class/pose/state divergence; do not optimize sparse pass 2 until that
quality boundary is known.

## Decision Log

Resolved with the user on 2026-07-11:

- RELION GUI semantics are the default until strict parity closes. Major
  behaviors remain typed, switchable options so later grid-correction,
  angle-refinement, and other scientific ablations do not require rewrites.
- Full K=1 trajectory parity closes before K=4; supplied-map EM closes before
  native InitialModel/VDAM.
- Discrete comparisons are tie-aware. A winner flip is acceptable only when
  underlying scores/posteriors prove a numerical near-tie. Convergence and
  finalization are expected to match exactly.
- K=1 closure spans multiple seeds, white/colored noise, CTF/no-CTF,
  uniform/preferred angular distributions, contrast/noise-scale variation,
  translation stress, and junk/outliers, followed by a well-characterized
  real-particle confirmation and a 100k/256 completion run.
- At scale, compare complete aggregate iteration state plus stratified score
  surfaces, automatically dumping every mismatch for full investigation.
- RECOVAR and RELION timing pairs use the same GPU model. Any available cluster
  GPU class is valid; local use is capped at three confirmed-idle GPUs.
- Up to three subagents may perform independent bounded investigations, with
  one writer per source area and the primary agent owning integration.
- Preserve the existing dirty candidate and create a separate clean local
  checkpoint/logical commit history. Do not push without separate approval.

## Queue Discipline

Keep at most one active quality hypothesis and one independent read-only audit.
Rank backlog items by expected information gained per GPU-hour. A run without a
predeclared decision it can change should not be submitted. Negative results
must be recorded so future agents do not repeat them.
