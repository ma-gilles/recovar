# Current EM development scope

The current milestone is behavior-preserving cleanup and development setup
across RECOVAR, with EM prioritized. GUI/frontend work and the new HIA engine
are outside this milestone. EM public APIs may change when they simplify the
code; migrate callers, tests and documentation together. Preserve non-EM APIs,
saved formats, numerical behavior and scientific defaults. Present numerical
repairs separately for a user decision.

## Source and review

The control is PR158 commit
`44d770de3f9336ab2f3f6a34203394bae8d1aeed`. The implementation branch is
`codex/recovar-structural-cleanup`, created directly from that control.
An earlier preparation branch mixes structural changes, runtime repairs and
GUI work; its commits and benchmark results do not qualify this selected series.

The full source review covered 1,654 text files and 89 other assets. Its finding
inventory, selection evidence, exact test commands and live job records are
stored on Della under:

```text
/scratch/gpfs/CRYOEM/gilleslab/mg6942/em_dev/hia_source_review_20260906/
```

Use `WORK_STATE.json`, `REVIEW_FOR_SCOPE_DECISION.md`,
`PREPARED_CHANGE_INVENTORY.md` and `structural_cleanup/` there. Preserve their
source identities when incorporating evidence into a future PR.

## Selected cleanup evidence

| Change | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Four unused private diagnostic/test helpers and one constant | `e8aaf5fad`; retained AST unchanged; 28 tests passed, Slurm13561657 |
| Unused public external-normalizer EM M-step wrapper | `5f6c35a40`; retained executable AST unchanged; 24 tests passed, Slurm13561804 |
| Fourteen private plotting, projection, PPCA and test helpers | `3ca69ab3f`; retained AST unchanged; 48 tests passed, Slurm13561946 |
| Dormant single-class significance scorer | `a525e87ef`; existing tests migrated to the active K1-via-Kclass path; 5 passed, Slurm13562507 |
| Duplicate EM environment parsers | `20a4b8235`; parser bodies unchanged; 5 caller checks passed, Slurm13562574 |
| API documentation and isolated docs environment | `1d1d6371f`; 14 tests and strict docs build passed, Slurm13562695; all 58 reviewed API functions rendered; all 496 original packages unchanged |
| Private embedding/state/linalg helpers | `48776ce7b`; retained AST unchanged apart from unused standard-library import; 143 passed, 7 GPU cases deselected, Slurm13562799 |
| Unreachable cubic-mask branch | `924187933`; existing linear policy preserved; 4 tests and 32 exact original/candidate comparisons passed, Slurm13562921 |
| Ten identical JSON conversion helpers | `358db66f3`; shared body unchanged; 16 tests and 10 CLI import/help checks passed, Slurm13563062 |

These are focused checks, not full quality or performance qualification.
Counts describe each validation job and may overlap. No scientific tolerance
or established baseline was changed.

The retired public EM wrapper is
`local_score_pass.fused_score_normalize_mstep_abs2_with_log_z_on_demand`.
It had no repository callers. Its external-normalizer support calculation
remains available through
`fused_score_normalize_support_probs_abs2_with_log_z_on_demand`; active callers
perform M-step reductions after packing significant rows. The common fused
`fused_score_normalize_mstep_abs2_on_demand` API remains available.

Report scripts now share `recovar.utils.json_utils.to_jsonable`. Conversion
preserves the old NumPy/path/nested-container behavior. It does not establish
that metrics are finite or that a report satisfies an acceptance policy.

## Current qualification gaps

The benchmark contract covers synthetic and real data, including K1, K4 and
K2/K8/K16; see [benchmarks](benchmarks.md). Preserve the existing failed cells.
The earlier mixed candidate passes the scoped K2 comparison, but its real K1
trajectory converges after 16 iterations versus the control's 17, and its final
merged-map direct FSC-AUC is 0.949891246, below the unchanged 0.995 gate. Repeated
synthetic K1 measurements also retain an unresolved host-RSS warning over 10%.
Those results cannot establish a behavior-preserving or performance-qualified
cleanup. Follow the external ledger for the complete reports and pending jobs.

PR158's K-class path has a separately identified undefined-variable bug. Its
prepared one-line policy repair is held outside this structural series pending
its separate correctness decision. Label any baseline containing that repair
as a repaired control, never as the unchanged PR158 source.

## Next check

The initial structural series and strict documentation build have passed their
focused checks. The separate K-class correctness decision is pending. Two
unchanged-PR158 real-data repeats are running in Slurm13562724, with comparison
job13562837, to test repeatability before attributing the earlier candidate's
trajectory difference to a source change. The two repeats share an allocated
H100; its UUID differs from the original control, which the report must retain.

Finish the baseline/evidence review, then freeze a candidate for the applicable
shared and EM regression workloads. Larger executor extraction and the new
engine remain later work. Keep numerical fixes separate until approved.

The [historical program](../math/em_parity_program.md),
[parity notes](../math/relion_parity_agent_notes.md) and
[completion records](../math/em_parity_best_metrics.md) retain quantitative
gates and dated evidence. Their old next actions are historical context.
